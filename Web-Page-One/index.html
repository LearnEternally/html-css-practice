    <h1>This is a heading.</h1>
      <p>This sentence implies that <strong>it is very important</strong> due to the natural implications that headings give. Headings <em>imply a hierarchy</em> to the content.</p>

    <h2>This is a heading.</h2>
      <p>This would be less important than the one above.</p>

    <h3>This is a heading.</h3>
      <p>This is even less important.</p>      

    <h4>This is a heading.</h4>
      <p>This is even less important than the one above it.</p>

    <h5>This is a heading.</h5>
      <p>So on.</p>

    <h6>This is a heading.</h6>
      <p>And so forth.</p>
